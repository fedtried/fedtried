### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Federica Donald

I'm a final year student studying a bachelors in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. I've also self taught myself web development skills (full stack) as well as Java. My proficiency in languages can be seen below. When I'm not working towards my degree or doing one of my coding side projects, you can find me watching YouTube videos of professional players so I can improve my gaming skills. I'm also an avid swimmer and used to train competetively so I regularly go to the gym and swim to keep up both my physical and mental fitness.
